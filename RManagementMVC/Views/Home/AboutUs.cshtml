            <p class="lead text-center mb-4">In the heart of Silicon Valley, a group of passionate .NET developers found themselves pondering life beyond the screen. Jake, Sarah, and Mike had spent years crafting elegant code and building robust applications, but they shared a secret passion: the culinary arts.</p>
            <p>One fateful hackathon night, fueled by pizza and energy drinks, they realized their true calling. They decided to hang up their keyboards and don chef's aprons, trading brackets for basil and loops for ladles. Thus, "Byte & Bite" was born – a restaurant where technology meets gastronomy.</p>
